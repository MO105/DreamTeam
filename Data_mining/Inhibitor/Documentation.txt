The information for the inhibitors such as the list of inhibitors with its targets were retrieved as a csv file from http://www.kinase-screen.mrc.ac.uk/ on the 29th of Janurary. 
The csv file is stored as "kinase_inhibitor_list". All the inhibitors that did not contain a value for the "Action" column were removed. 

The column of PubChem CID was extracted into a new csv called "Pubchem" without the header. The reason for this is because to upload a list of ID's to pubchem, csv file has to contain one id per line and it must only consist of integers. Therefore, the header was removed.
All the blank spaces were deleted in excel. This list of CIDs was uploaded to pubchem and a csv file was downloaded which contained many information about that CID. 

The link for the images were obtained from http://www.kinase-screen.mrc.ac.uk/ by web scrapping using Beautiful soup. The reason for this is because the link of the inhibitor images had different names to the inhibitor.
